These questions can be mathematically framed as Bayesian inverse problems.\nWhile powerful and sophisticated approaches have been developed to tackle these problems,\nsuch methods are often challenging to implement and typically require first\nand second order derivatives that are not always available in existing computational models.  The MUQ-hIPPYlib integrated framework overcomes this hurdle by providing unprecedented access\nto state-of-the-art algorithms for deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems.\nMUQ provides a spectrum of powerful Bayesian inversion models and algorithms,\nbut expects forward models to come equipped with gradients/Hessians to permit large-scale solution.\nhIPPYlib implements powerful large-scale gradient/Hessian-based solvers in an environment\nthat can automatically generate needed derivatives, but it lacks full Bayesian capabilities.\nBy integrating these two libraries, we created a robust, scalable, and efficient software\nframework that realizes the benefits of each to tackle complex large-scale Bayesian inverse\nproblems across a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering areas.",
